# Button Smash Race

A race to mash a button the fastest

Used to be called Button Mash Race, but students agreed that they liked the name Button Smash Race better.

# How it works

There are two players, Green and Blue. There are two buttons, Green and Blue. As Green player smashes their button, the strip lights up green from their end. As Blue player smashes their button, the strip lights up blue from their end.
When the colors meet in the middle, they push back and forth. Whoever smashes the fastest pushes their colors to the other side and wins. 

There's a brief countdown, and then the Button Smash Race begins again.

# What you need to build this

- Two buttons, or anything that can complete the button circuit

- a set of neopixels. I used 20 in a strip, but you can use any number, and any shape

- Arduino, or Microbit. There is code for both in this repo.

- Power supply, usb cables, etc

- Creativity: how will you assemble these things together into something fun?

# How to Assemble

Review the code to see which pins go to the buttons and the neopixels. There's no need for any external pullup resistors or capacitors. 

You can make your own choices on how the asemble this into a fuctioning game. My version is built into a heavy board, using a CNC machine, 3 printer, laser cutter, and other tools. But there's no need to build it that way. 

# Credits
I first saw this game at a mini maker event somewhere in Europe, I can't remember where. If I can figure it out, I'll add it here. Probably that wasn't the first iteration of this game, it's just the one I saw. But big thanks to whoever made it first.
